# Academic Template 

This repository is meant for those academics who want a base template for their
academic website. It is a Bootstrap template, so better refer the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for changing the style.

This project is meant to directly clone in your servers' `public_html` folder, since it has all
the dependencies installed.
